//! Pro plugin registry — runtime extension point for Pro features.
//!
//! The free binary ships with basic functionality. The Pro dylib
//! registers additional capabilities at startup via this registry.
//! All access is through the global REGISTRY singleton.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The registry stores function pointers and data registered by pro.dylib.
//! The free binary checks `pro_registry::has(Feature)` before showing
//! Pro-gated UI or returning Pro-gated MCP data.
//!
//! This replaces the old `tier.is_pro()` pattern — Pro features are
//! no longer gated by a flag in the free binary. They're either
//! registered (dylib loaded) or not.
